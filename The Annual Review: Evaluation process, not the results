The Annual Review: Evaluation process, not the results

As the year draws to a close, a few individuals exude confidence while many remain reticent.

Year-end summaries often boast of tangible achievements, while the prospects for the upcoming year are filled with aspirations for desired outcomes. Upon closer inspection, the confident ones typically have positive results to show, receiving affirmations. On the other hand, the silent ones may feel their outcomes are not up to par.

Speaking through results is a value system that seldom raises doubts, wearing a face of inherent correctness. Yet, during my consulting years, I've glimpsed alternative perspectives.

1. Are Your Favored Outcomes Too Narrow?

With each passing natural year, subtle changes accumulate over time. However, most of these alterations go unnoticed, as our assessments often revolve around just a handful of outcomes. From a broader, long-term perspective, six subsystems influence enduring transformations:

(Time Energy) Resource Allocation System,
Self-awareness System,
Relationship Pattern System,
Skill Enhancement System,
Health System,
Faith System.

While these subsystems rarely make it into our year-end evaluations, their transformations are exceptionally challenging and valuable. They impact the entire person and nurture enduring changes. Have these six subsystems undergone positive changes for you? I believe everyone has experienced gratitude-worthy transformations in these dimensions.

2. Reflecting on the Impact of a "Results-Oriented Hero" Mindset

I've personally followed this pattern. Positive outcomes bring high energy and motivation, while the absence of results or positive feedback leads to internal conflicts and diminished energy. Even with some accomplishments, comparing them to others may result in internal strife and reduced motivation. Many unproductive moments in life are a result of this cycle. Every dog has its day, and while this cycle brings joy, it also ushers in wasted years. Yet, the allure of this game is undeniable.

My years in energy management consulting further validate this cycle. Positivity and high energy accompany favorable outcomes, while internal conflicts and low energy follow poor results, creating a repetitive cycle.

All individual efforts operate within an underlying trend. Economic landscapes change, and this shift alters the balance between these two aspects. The current trend leans towards increased difficulty. Unlike the past, where high growth provided ample positive feedback, the current landscape involves contraction, making opportunities more challenging to seize.

You'll notice that the ratio of high to low energy, once at 7:3 or 6:4, has now shifted to 3:7 or 4:6. This model predicts an increase in those embracing a laid-back approach, along with a rise in internal conflicts and low energy.

Persisting with the "Results-Oriented Hero" mindset makes it difficult to escape these internal conflicts and fluctuations. While external challenges can be overcome, internal conflicts erode from within. Upon observation, those who truly surrender are not defeated by challenging environments but rather succumb due to weariness.

As the ancients wisely said, Tranquility leads to distance. However, if inner turmoil persists, true accumulation for long-term change becomes elusive.

Switching values is a challenging endeavor, and I've undergone only slight changes over the years.

3. God's Evaluation Process Unveiled

The following parable, known for the Matthew effect, is essentially about the evaluation process:

“For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property.To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away.He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more.So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.’His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.’His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed,so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed?Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest.So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

In a business context, the one earning five talents would undoubtedly be celebrated as a star (whether an entrepreneurial star or an outstanding employee). The one earning two talents would pale in comparison because human hearts tend to idolize results.
 However, in God's eyes, both receive the same evaluation: "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness." This value system is not only comforting but also encouraging. God assesses the process, examining whether we have been faithful in what has already been entrusted to us. It's not a matter of relentless self-striving coupled with leniency towards oneself; the truth lies in being faithful in the process and showing reverence for results to God.

4. About 2024, I Share a Recently Learned Concept: "Passive Initiative"

This term originates from theology.
Being passive implies not constantly striving to take the initiative in achieving grand goals.
Being positive means bringing to life the efforts already received, excelling in entrusted tasks, and harvesting the low-hanging fruits in life.
The fusion of these concepts is termed passive initiative.

This closely aligns with the A+ strategy we've emphasized. Rather than hastily reaching point B and allowing it to consume all your resources, ground yourself in point A, perfect it to the fullest, and "You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things," transforming it into A+.

In conclusion,

The motivation behind this article stems from self-reflection.
In 2023, I achieved some successes but fell short in other areas. As I perused the dazzling year-end summaries of others, I noticed my mind becoming confused and anxious.
The root cause lies in a clash of values, simultaneously evaluating myself using two sets of values: the "Results-Oriented Hero" and the "God's Evaluation Process." This results in the current state of confusion.
Writing this article serves as a reminder to return to the value system of God's evaluation process, being faithful to the process, and expressing gratitude for the results.
Once again, I'm organizing my inner self, casting a vote with my actions for a value system I genuinely believe in.
"Rely on faith, adhere to principles, fulfill your duties; understand the void, follow the timing, and enjoy your share of blessings."
