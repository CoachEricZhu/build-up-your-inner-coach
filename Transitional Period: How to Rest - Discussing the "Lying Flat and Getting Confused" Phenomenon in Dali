Transitional Period: How to Rest - Discussing the "Lying Flat and Getting Confused" Phenomenon in Dali

An essential feature of the transitional period is that people are almost exhausted and need a break.

But why do some people become more energetic during their break, while others become more confused?

Many people quit their jobs to lie flat in Dali. Let's discuss how to view rest during the transitional period using this term.

1. Basic Needs: Behind "Lying Flat" is Recuperation, and Behind Recuperation is Preparation for Transition

"Lying flat" is a playful term, and many people joke about coming to Dali to "lie flat."

But if you delve into a conversation with them, you will find that behind this self-deprecating term often lies confusion about the next step in their transition.

While many take a break and some become increasingly lost, others embark energetically on the next phase of their lives.

The choice of words determines your mindset. When you use the term "lying flat," you unwittingly share a cognitive context with people whose values are fundamentally different from yours.

Some people are here to recuperate for a while, while others are genuinely preparing to slack off. Some echo popular sentiments, while others just want to escape. When people say "lying flat," the meanings can vary.

If your deeper need is for Dali to help you recuperate and settle, facilitating a smoother transition, then you should be cautious about using the term "lying flat."

However, you can still engage in activities that resemble "lying flat"; it's just that they are aimed at entirely different goals.

2. Dali's Value for the Transitional Period: Nurturing Environment, Psychological Space, Marginal Value Network

These three aspects are key terms for resting during the transitional period, and Dali aligns exceptionally well with them. You can also search for these keywords in your environment.

A: Nurturing Environment

Recovering from the high energy expenditure in your previous job is a sound strategy in a nurturing environment. The first step in most transitions is to recover from a low energy state, and this is where a nurturing environment can be beneficial.

Dali offers an excellent natural environment. Importantly, I now have an office desk with a sea view. Though work is demanding, the nurturing environment is strong.

B: Psychological Space

In a first-tier city, everyone's psychological space is limited. The pace of work, commuting, and lifestyle occupy all your attention resources. Without space, there are no new possibilities. The first step in transitioning is to loosen the tight system and create space for oneself.

This is also the charm of the city. Yesterday, while walking, I saw someone lying on a deck chair watching their cat chase rabbits on the lawn. It was quite touching.

Idle moments and downtime create new psychological space, crucial for thoughtful transitions.

C: Marginal Value Network

Although this city has become a mainstream tourist destination, it is entirely a marginal value network from a work perspective. Marginal value networks are often gathering places for ecological diversity. Being on the periphery doesn't necessarily mean more resources or a better life, but it does mean encountering different life forms.

People (referring to residents) you meet here are indeed different from most people I encountered in Beijing and Shanghai, sometimes quite enlightening.

During your transition, try to go to places with marginal value networks, spend time with people permanently residing there, rather than with tourists.

3. Besides Being Cautious About "Lying Flat," Be Mindful of Conceptual Confusion

Confusion often arises when various concepts enter during times of uncertainty. People in transition have many latent needs, such as various forms of spiritual healing or fortune-telling. Dali,  offers plenty in this regard. Exercise caution and discernment; build your internal structure on solid ground, not on shifting sands.

In conclusion, from the perspective of energy thinking, coming to Dali's nurturing environment is to restore energy for high-energy transition tasks.

Only with high energy consumption and no nourishment, a person will quickly deplete.

Only with nourishment and no high-energy tasks, a person will quickly feel empty.

With both nourishment and energy consumption, life can grow in this dynamic process.
