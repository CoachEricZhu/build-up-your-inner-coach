When a family member is diagnosed with cancer, people are often in a state of confusion. However, this is precisely the time when a series of decisions need to be made, and these decisions will significantly impact the direction of future events. This article aims to provide a simple communication decision-making framework to help clarify one's thoughts.

## Principle 1: First, Address the Issue of "Transparent Communication"

The first decision people need to make is whether to be transparent about the diagnosis. Most people tend to hide the truth from the patient, citing the "principle of compassion." However, this principle is only applicable in a few special cases and is not suitable for most situations.
 People tend to protect the other person's emotions by avoiding the topic of cancer. The patient is worried about burdening their family, and the family is worried about the patient's feelings, leading to a "protective buffering" communication mechanism. Research shows that this is not a good strategy. A better approach is supportive and open communication, which helps both the patient and family members feel more satisfied and discuss the illness more smoothly.

If transparent communication is not possible, the entire family cannot effectively discuss treatment strategies, leading to hasty and compromised treatment plans. Additionally, many feelings cannot be understood and affirmed, resulting in invisible pressure throughout the treatment process, which is extremely exhausting.

People are indeed afraid to face the truth, and it can cause emotional shock. However, humans are complex, and their desires often conflict. Patients also long for their complex feelings to be acknowledged, understood, and discussed. They want someone who can resonate with them. Studies show that family members' support and validation of their experiences and emotions are crucial for patients. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that fear will crush the patient. The ongoing loneliness and inexpressible pressure can sometimes be more damaging. The support and open discussion about the illness brought by transparent communication often outweigh the drawbacks.

## Principle 2: Establish a Sense of Control Amidst the Chaos

Discovering cancer is a loss of control for both the patient and family members, which is the first layer of anxiety. The second layer of anxiety comes from imagining how bad the future will be. The second layer of anxiety is often more destructive. With a foundation of "transparent communication," people can discuss three themes to reduce the second layer of anxiety. The sooner these three themes are clearly defined, the more it helps reduce the more destructive additional anxiety.

There are three topics that need to be communicated:

A: Medical Information + Decision-Making Criteria

Research shows that cancer patients prefer open discussions and want to learn as much medical information as possible to make informed decisions. 
More medical information includes: understanding the disease, various treatment options and their effects, how to access them, case studies, etc. 
The key here is: gathering authoritative information from reliable sources vs. marketing accounts. Treating cancer is a business with high demand, and the market is chaotic. Marketing accounts' sensational claims and overpromising by those in the cancer treatment business can cause more confusion. Therefore, collecting information from authoritative sources, simplifying and organizing it, is crucial for the patient's sense of control. This is something family members can help with. Confidence in treatment comes from a systematic understanding of the disease, not from success stories promoted by others. This is a topic that needs to be repeatedly discussed.

Discussing medical decision-making criteria is also necessary. Be wary of both overindulgence and overinvestment. Understanding the limitations of medicine, fulfilling the role of a good steward, and making calm and balanced decisions can help both the patient and family members remain calm.

B: Family Burden
This is a concerning topic that people often avoid discussing. It involves financial issues and caregivers adjusting their lives. Making clear financial and time arrangements early on and communicating this plan can help alleviate invisible anxiety.

C: Relationships
Relationships involve not only family members but also other important relatives, friends, and others. A challenge is how to communicate transparently with others the patient cares about. Patients are often conflicted, fearing others' worry while also longing to resonate with them. The principle here is that the patient has the right to share their illness with others at their own pace. You can suggest, but you must respect their pace. On the other hand, knowing that strangers are also praying for them can be a powerful source of support, which often happens in churches.

## Principle 3: Discuss the Underlying Views on Life and Death When Appropriate

The first question in the Heidelberg Catechism is: "What is your only comfort in life and death?" (You can search for the answer yourself.)

Everyone has their own beliefs, but this moment tests whether what we believe is steadfast. You may find that what seemed clear in normal times may now waver or be doubted. Honest reflection gives us another opportunity to contemplate questions we usually avoid or only superficially consider.

If you find that your conversations with family members are only about medical treatment and never touch on deeper aspects of life, this is a reminder to discuss these topics. Even if cancer is medically treated, everyone eventually dies. But if this opportunity is used to reconsider the relationship between humans and God, everything will change.

Finally, I have compiled a list of topics discussed most frequently in cancer patient support groups. Although most people do not participate in support groups, this list reflects the concerns of patients at this stage and serves as a reference for communication between family members and patients.

* Sharing emotions and experiences
* Discussing real-life problems, such as work disruptions, financial issues, caregiving responsibilities, and planning
* Comparing different treatment options, including standard treatments, complementary therapies, alternative treatment plans, and the latest treatment options
* Dealing with side effects, both physical and psychological, such as fatigue, nausea, pain, and anxiety
* Changes in family member responsibilities and roles, repairing relationships
* Communicating with doctors
* Survival rates, life after treatment, fear of recurrence
* Disease progression and end-of-life topics
* The meaning of life and the soul's destination

This is the scope of communication you should engage in when accompanying a family member with cancer.
