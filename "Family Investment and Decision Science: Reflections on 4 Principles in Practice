"Family Investment and Decision Science: Reflections on 4 Principles in Practice

The Bilibili stocks purchased by two kids with their New Year's money have plummeted by 90%. One suggests doubling down, while the other advises a quick sell. I find this intriguing, as many adults aren't much wiser in such matters, yet these kids are already contemplating decision-making at their age.

While investing isn't my expertise, decision-making is. Investing is simply a specific application of decision-making. Consequently, I've been writing investment notes to delve into the decision-making mechanisms behind it. My self-designed investment coach has evolved to its third edition, containing around 190,000 words of reflections and notes. Investing is a foundational decision-making skill, and by the time my investment coach reaches its tenth edition, I anticipate becoming a more seasoned investor.

Here are some insights from my investment coach on my investment practices:

1. **Same Money + Different Emotions = Different Decisions**

   The principle is that money isn't naked; it's wrapped in emotional layers. Money earned through hard work is treated cautiously, while money from lottery winnings might be spent recklessly. In practice, I've observed that I allocate attention differently to various investment portfolios based on the associated emotions. I find myself deeply analyzing my favorite American stock investment account, assuming it to be the default when discussing investments. However, this account represents only a portion of my portfolio. To address this bias, I've created an enforced checklist to observe other assets, improving my balance slightly. 
Emotional attachment to investments is common, leading to excessive emotional involvement. Yet, detachment doesn't guarantee rationality; it may trigger a different form of irrationality.

2. **Top-Down or Bottom-Up Approach**

   Are you better at analyzing from macro to micro or vice versa? While I understand both approaches theoretically, successful investors, when you read their materials, each tends to have a preferred sequence. Personally, I excel at micro-level analysis but struggle with macroeconomic analysis. Despite my lack of understanding and the inability to judge who truly understands it, a significant portion of my investment portfolio is influenced by macroeconomic analysis.
 I need to admit my limitations, acknowledge past instances of pretending to understand, and gradually adjust this imbalance by incorporating more of what I excel at.

3. **Investment Styles: Football Analogy**

   Referring to 'The Most Important Thing of Investment’ there's a comparison of investment styles to football strategies. It emphasizes the importance of choosing between offense, defense, or a balanced approach. My reflection is that I've pursued a too-balanced strategy, increasingly questioning its efficacy. Now, I lean towards either an offensive or defensive counter-attack style. The most successful football teams often align with these extremes. For my limited investment resources, a rational choice is a 'defensive counter-attack'—keeping a few players who can score goals while focusing on robust defensive players, avoiding the balanced but vulnerable ones.

4. **Status Quo Bias**

   The principle is our strong tendency to cling to existing things. We assume the present is the best, the most comfortable default setting. While it's convincing to argue for making fewer decisions and avoiding frequent adjustments, it's equally vital to guard against status quo bias. Even when logic has shifted, reluctance to adjust persists. 
I've been procrastinating adjustments to an investment, and part of the purpose of this article is to push myself to break free from status quo bias and address this matter.

In conclusion,

The power of decision biases is formidable; sometimes, it controls you right under your nose. My insight is to continually refine and upgrade the underlying decision system. Facing it, challenging it, and aligning it with contrary thinking will foster growth over time. These are recent reflections from my practice.
