Unlocking the Secrets of Collaboration for Kids: Win-Win Tactics + A Dash of Compromise

Guiding children to grow involves navigating the challenges of inherent self-centeredness. Here, I'll share insights on fostering collaboration between two kids in handling household chores.

1. Prioritize Collaboration: Growth Efficiency > Task Efficiency

While it might be more efficient for them to tackle different chores independently, I insist they team up. Yes, it adds managerial complexities, but it's a deliberate choice for fostering growth efficiency, not just completing tasks efficiently.

2. Clarify the Training Focus

I emphasize to the kids that blaming, shirking responsibility, and complaining come naturally—they don't need practice. However, qualities like not blaming, avoiding excuses, and embracing collaboration require intentional training. So, it's crucial for the kids to understand the purpose behind their collaborative efforts.

3. Navigate Disputes with Principles

Specifically, it's "win-win" in negotiation and "take a little loss" in carry out. These two must be combined; having only one is problematic. Win-win negotiation means you are not self-centered and can take care of the other's needs; at the same time, you do not please the other, and you can take care of your own interests. By showing a clear win-win strategy, you can outwit the opponent and eliminate the idea of using clever tricks in advance.

Taking a little loss means you are not foolish (you can negotiate a win-win), but you actively choose to take a little loss to make cooperation easier. There are always loopholes in cooperative negotiations, and everyone hopes and is willing to cooperate with someone who is willing to take a little loss. This is also an important value, especially in the business world of smart people.

4. Intervention When Necessary

In situations where one insists on a win-lose approach, I make it clear that such a stance leads to unilateral losses—twice. This helps curb self-centered tendencies. This process isn't easy, as common cooperative pitfalls involve being "too clever" or "too honest." Balancing it simplifies cooperation.

To conclude, a favorite verse of mine from the Gospel of Matthew states, "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."
