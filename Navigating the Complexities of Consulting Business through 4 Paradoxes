The essence of consulting, described as the art of influencing people based on their requests, echoes a definition I admire from Weinberg's "The Secrets of Consulting." As an art form, consulting inherently holds conflicting tensions. Therefore, the path to optimizing and enhancing consulting doesn't start with specific business models but rather with embracing these tensions. The following four paradoxes, born out of reflection on personal experiences and observations in the consulting business, are shared with you.

Client Paradox: Those who need you the least, those who urgently need you, and those who need you secondarily.
Clients who need you the least often theoretically need you the most but practically need you the least. Their blind spots hide the changes they genuinely need, yet these remain invisible to them.
Urgently needing clients often see you as a lifeline, but they pose the highest risk. Clients who genuinely need you tend to idealize and then devalue, setting up an inevitable burst of the idealization bubble when it exceeds your capacity.
Clients needing you secondarily are the best. They recognize your value but don't overly depend on you, allowing for growth within their systems. Regardless of how insightful your consultation is, it needs to take root and sprout in their system.
Reflection: This tension influences our client strategy. Attention is often drawn to clients who need us the least or those who urgently need us, leading to conquest or carrying excessive expectations. Clients with a balanced mindset often yield the best consulting results.

Practical  Consultant vs. Methodology Consultant Paradox:
Practical consultants excel in intuition, directly engaging and strategizing with clients in real-time battles. Methodology consultants have their models, providing clients with structured insights that yield results.
Those who prefer a "just do it" approach lean towards being practical consultants, best serving clients with a similar mindset, and reinforcing each other. Those inclined towards researching fundamentals and underlying methodologies lean towards being methodology consultants, excelling in serving clients seeking new methodologies and logic.
Reflection: This tension impacts our service content. However, just like in the first paradox, what each person most needs is ironically what they least desire. Clients who love to delve into the essence often appreciate conceptual discussions, yet sometimes lack the trial-and-error spirit of "just do it."

Sell Results vs. Sell Process Paradox:
Some consultants sell results, analogous to a person being satiated after consuming seven pancakes, selling the outcome of contentment. Others sell the process, offering a piece of the pancake, whether it's the first or seventh, something beyond their control.
Consultants focusing on selling results shoulder more significant risks, confronting uncontrollable variables, necessitating careful selection of projects. Those selling the process hone in on building the expertise of that one slice, making it an indispensable link in the value chain. With established expertise, this slice can find applications in various scenarios.
Reflection: This tension influences our service design. Despite achieving positive results in result-oriented consulting, I've consistently leaned towards process-oriented consulting. While the outcomes have been commendable, I find myself remaining in a process-centric perspective. It prompts questions about whether this reflects an inclination to avoid pressure or a growing sense of limitation.

Sell Diagnosis vs. Sell Medicine Paradox:
Drawing a parallel to a hospital, selling a diagnosis involves an objectively analyzed strategy to discover the most suitable recommendations for the client. Selling medicine becomes the vessel for the solution, like a financial advisor recommending a fund.
The conflict in selling diagnosis and medicine is palpable. Posing as a doctor primarily selling medicine, especially one's own, represents the worst-case scenario.
Reflection: This tension affects our alignment of interests with clients. As consultants develop their products (books, courses, or theories), they start selling medicine rather than providing entirely objective analysis to help clients find the best solutions. As someone who enjoys developing my theories, I'm aware that my motivation for objective analysis is subtly influenced by the drive to sell medicine. It requires constant vigilance or a gradual transition to either separate the two or transform into a medicine seller.  

In Conclusion:
Clients and consultants alike in the business world are complex beings filled with anxiety, insecurity, and intricate emotions. No one can truly remain completely objective and neutral in their work. Our complex motivations affect the business models we adopt, client choices, and the depth and breadth of our services. Therefore, facing our complex motivations is the starting point for improving our work.
