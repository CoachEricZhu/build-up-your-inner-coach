Today, let's discuss an internal struggle for sensitive entrepreneurs or a source of pride for those who aren't sensitive: emotional dullness.

1.motional Dullness

This concept comes from the writer Junichi Watanabe and it suggests not being overly sensitive to everything that happens. In the business world, it describes the ability to handle setbacks, pain, and criticism with composure. In my consulting work, I've heard many business professionals talk about this concept. Some are distressed by their lack of emotional dullness, while others take pride in not letting anything get to them.

2.Emotional Detachment

Emotional detachment is a psychological concept that involves not being aware of one's emotions or the emotions of others. It's considered a defense mechanism. If you find yourself unable to recognize your emotions, it's a sign that your defense mechanism may be too rigid. From a psychological perspective, a fractured childhood can lead to emotional detachment. How does this relate to the success associated with emotional dullness?

3.The Value of Emotions: Empathy in Business

In business, we often talk about emotional resilience to avoid letting negative emotions take control, whether it's in the face of criticism or challenges. But here's the thing: emotions are incredibly valuable in the business world. Empathy is the key to innovation, and it relies on connecting through emotions. Emotional value is at the heart of creativity. Leadership, too, draws its strength from understanding the emotions of others. While management can sometimes afford to be less concerned about emotions, true leaders are individuals who deeply understand people's feelings.

4.The Right Path to Growth: Sensitivity and Strategy

Consider it like a radar system, with both antennas and algorithms. Some people naturally have highly precise radar antennas, but they need to work on their algorithms. Otherwise, they'll be on high alert all the time, even when facing minor issues. But if they ditch their precision antennas altogether, they may become emotionally distant and lose their edge. For some, growing up in tough circumstances forced them to detach from their emotions for survival. While this emotional detachment has its advantages, it's vital to acknowledge its limitations in areas like family, team dynamics, or connecting with customers.

So, how can you maintain your sensitivity (keeping those high-precision antennas) without letting negative emotions take over? It mainly comes down to your strategy. Besides the challenge of distinguishing between real threats and minor issues, another common issue is when your ego and emotions are tightly intertwined. All the emotions that truly consume us are linked to our ego. For example:

A setback isn't just a setback; it's a hit to my self-worth.

Criticism isn't just about the issue; it's a blow to my value.

Pain isn't just pain; it's questioning why it's happening to me.

When external changes threaten your core identity, it's time to reflect on your strategy and make necessary adjustments. That's also when true personal growth happens.

Junichi Watanabe, the writer, is known for his strong emotional awareness, which sets him apart in his field. So, don't let the term 'emotional resilience' mislead you. If you've been feeling emotionally distant, it might be time to embrace the high-precision antennas you've neglected. Alternatively, when intense emotions are throwing you off balance, it's time to reevaluate your strategy. It's time to make some important fixes.
