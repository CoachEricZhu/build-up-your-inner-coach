New plans are like trying a new cake. Sometimes you swallow it whole, only to spit it out. You might try breaking it into smaller bites, but it still gets rejected. It's painful, but some plans are too crucial to abandon. That's when you need to check your system for rejection responses.
A Simple Example
Imagine someone wanting to get fit. They have the motivation, time, and discipline, yet their fitness plan fails. Examining their system, you find perfectionist beliefs at work and guilt about not spending time with family. These factors combined lead to the plan's rejection. Persisting only increases tension, inevitably leading to failure.
Five Dimensions of System Rejection
Fixed Beliefs:
Beliefs like "exercising after work is selfish" or "clients trust me because my work is perfect" need to be redefined.
Relationship Patterns:
Different tasks involve different relationship patterns. Writing articles and appearing in videos might seem compatible, but if the underlying patterns clash, rejection occurs.
Default Capabilities:
Every new plan requires certain inherent capabilities. Lacking these, like advanced language skills for complex tasks, triggers rejection.
Priority and Resource Allocation:
If your high-energy task is scheduled for a low-energy time, your system won't support it. Reallocate resources or enhance overall energy.
Motivation and Internal Consumption:
Lack of confidence in success, often due to past failures, is a common reason for rejection. Revisit failures with a fresh perspective to restore hope.
In Summary
Execution has boundaries defined by an individual's system rejection range. Some have broader boundaries, others narrower. Changing just one or two system factors can significantly ease the challenges of executing plans.
