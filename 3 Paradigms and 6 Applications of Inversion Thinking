If you search for the keyword 'reverse thinking' online, you'll find it has become a part of success philosophy and brain teasers.

However, if you genuinely want to understand reverse thinking and use it judiciously in important decisions, you need to grasp its meaning from different perspectives.

At its core, reverse thinking involves contemplating from the opposite side, divided into three main paradigms: reverse thinking, Janusian thinking, and Hegelian thinking. Since they all involve contemplating from opposing viewpoints, they often refer to themselves as practitioners of reverse thinking. If you search for books on inversion thinking, you'll find similar names with different connotations.

Now, let's briefly explore each paradigm and its applications.

1. **First Paradigm: Reverse Thinking**

   It involves transforming A into -A. There are three common applications:

   a. **Reversing Positive Goals:**
      Munger mainly discusses this part. For example, helping pilots (positive goal) involves contemplating how to most simply eliminate these pilots (negative goal). Similarly, for better governance in India (positive goal), reverse thinking considers how to most easily and severely destroy India (negative goal). Taking measures to avoid these negative goals often yields better results than directly pursuing positive goals.

   b. **Contrary to Public Opinion:**
      This is frequently used in investing, challenging widely accepted notions and encouraging independent thinking. The essence is captured by the saying in reverse investing: 'When everyone's ideas align, everyone is likely wrong,' or 'Too many people making the same prediction makes it unlikely to happen.' It's not as simple as being greedy when others are fearful or vice versa, as the key is to discern whether you are pessimistic or employing reverse thinking during market enthusiasm.

   c. **Discarding Key Issues:**
      Illustrated by Spielberg during the filming of 'Jaws,' where the expensive mechanical shark was challenging to use. Rather than solving this problem, Spielberg decided to shift focus from a Godzilla-style film to a Hitchcock-style film, minimizing the shark's appearance, resulting in the success of the movie. The strategy, as discussed in the book 'Life Will Find a Way â€“ Reverse Thinking to Solve Problems,' emphasizes that instead of tackling problems directly, reverse thinking explores how not solving the problem might lead to better outcomes.

2. **Second Paradigm: Janusian Thinking**

   Named after Janus, the Roman god with two faces looking in opposite directions, this paradigm involves holding contradictory ideas simultaneously. It has two applications:

   a. **Thought Growth:**
      Referencing a quote from 'The Great Gatsby': 'The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.' This type of thinking is discussed in my article 'Success and Growth: You Need Two Opposite Strategies.' Success requires emphasizing strengths and avoiding weaknesses, while growth demands confronting weaknesses and being wary of strengths.

   b. **Paradoxical Innovation Invention:**
      Classic examples of Janusian inventions include blinds that allow wind but block sunlight, a treadmill where you run without moving, a pencil with an eraser, and a boomerang that can fly toward enemies or back to the thrower. Such innovations embrace paradoxes by bravely integrating opposing elements to satisfy contradictions.

3. **Third Paradigm: Hegelian Thinking**

   When two opposing elements combine to form a completely different third entity, it's Hegelian thinking. An essential application is in family relationships:

   Explained in my article 'Antonym Personalities in Couples,' observing the traits of opposites in couples' relationships often results in children embodying both parents' shortcomings and strengths. By examining the child, a new entity emerges where the traits of the parents blend into a unique individual. This is Hegelian thinking applied to family dynamics.

In summary, this is a brief overview of the framework of reverse thinking. From the perspective of energy thinking, individuals can contemplate opposing views and beliefs when in a high-energy state. Overturning oneself requires substantial energy support. When in a low-energy state, attempting reverse thinking is challenging, serving more as a comfort in the cognitive repository.

Therefore, combining thinking models with mental states (energy perspective) produces optimal results.
