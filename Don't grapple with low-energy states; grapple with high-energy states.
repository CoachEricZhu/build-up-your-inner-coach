Don't grapple with low-energy states; grapple with high-energy states.


In the realm of energy management consultations, it's commonplace for individuals to seek advice due to low energy. Rarely do people seek guidance when their energy is high—this aligns with common intuition. However, the real key lies in optimizing those high-energy periods that everyone assumes don't need consultation.  Here are some contemplations on consultations:

1. Loss aversion propels people to grapple more with low energy.

People despise the sight of their lethargic selves and feel they shouldn't be in that state. 
The challenge is that grappling demands energy, and change necessitates energy. Low-energy periods lack this energy, resulting in often ineffective efforts. 
Struggling with low energy may make you feel worse, leading to further internal conflicts in low-energy states.

2. Even those with the lowest energy levels experience high-energy periods daily, but most fail to leverage them effectively.

Low-energy states throughout the day typically follow two distributions:

The first involves a constant decline in energy after noon, turning post-lunchtime into a "wasteland." 
The second sees individuals struggling to get up in the morning, remaining in a low-energy state until midday, with a slight recovery after noon. 
Past cases suggest that even those claiming severe depression, upon careful observation, experience periods of normal energy during the day, albeit infrequently.

The question then becomes: What are these periods used for? For most, the answer is that these times are utilized similarly to regular periods—tasks are approached as they come. Since the majority of us organize our time linearly, we miss the opportunity to schedule tasks according to an energy-matching principle, letting precious high-energy periods during low-energy times slip away.

3. Some practical tips

A: Engage in intense efforts during high-energy periods

Even if you're experiencing an overall low, you need to be rigorous with yourself during high-energy periods. Many individuals who attend energy management courses feel more accepting of themselves, but that understanding is only half the philosophy. Temporarily accepting low-energy periods is to grapple during high-energy periods. Tasks that genuinely bring about change must be densely packed into this timeframe, and these tasks are the ones that consume a lot of energy and guide you out of the trough. Only these changes can help you enter a positive cycle, reducing overall internal conflicts and pulling you out of the low. So, even in a short 2-3 hours, you need to boldly grapple.

B: Accept temporary low-energy periods instead of succumbing to them

Succumbing often reflects a sense of powerlessness in the face of overwhelming fatigue and isn't true acceptance. True acceptance aligns with its rhythm, engaging in activities that match its intensity. Therefore, reserve all low-energy tasks for this period instead of succumbing.
 If clients, colleagues, or superiors assign high-energy tasks during your low-energy period, what should you do? Postpone your response until your high-energy period. You can inform colleagues or clients that you are currently occupied and suggest addressing the issue together tomorrow morning (which is, in fact, your high-energy period). 
Most of the time, things aren't as urgent as they seem. The other party is simply eager to offload their anxiety onto you. Letting them know you've shouldered their anxiety often makes them less anxious.

Summary:
This may not be the most perfect solution, as I understand that people often wish for a burst of energy during low-energy periods to conquer all. This is precisely why stimulating drugs are so enticing—they offer a solution that aligns more with human nature after a state of lethargy. We hold different values, and for the gift of still having a high-energy period, we are grateful. Utilize the grace of this low period to drive change.
