Insufficient action, stemming from insufficient precision?
Elon Musk has an idea as below:
 
1.There are four types of motivation for action, and precision is just one of them.
From consulting experience, when the following scenarios occur, there may be a noticeable increase in motivation for action. These are:

A: Transition from ambiguity to clarity of path, a precise roadmap.

Musk talks about this kind. 
"Treasure maps" serve as a good metaphor for this. The appearance of a treasure map in a movie always triggers adventurous action. Similarly, in real life, when something has a clear "treasure map," it's essentially an action map—knowing what to do first, what to obtain, and then what challenges to overcome to reach the destination. Precision helps overcome the fear of the unknown, even the precise difficulties, aiding in initiating action.

B: A role model that works—someone else can make it work.

The most feared aspect isn't the difficulty but that the path doesn't work at all. What's even more frightening is that others can make it work, but not someone like me. However, if someone similar to oneself can make it work, it provides significant motivation. Examples from the weight loss industry are abundant. It's important to note that the role model should be similar to oneself. Just because a celebrity succeeds doesn't mean I can. However, if someone with a similar lifestyle, family, and hobbies can make it work, the motivation is immense.

C: New logic brings new paths—not that path, but this one.

Changes from consulting often stem from this. People who come for advice have often undergone consultations, read books, and tried various paths but are still stuck. At this point, breaking down tasks with the other person to find the usefulness of precision isn't very effective. But if you find that all the underlying assumptions of their action logic are wrong, or the logic's foundation is flawed, and deduce another path together, they acknowledge the whole deductive process, admitting that the original logic was wrong and should switch to another path. At this point, motivation for action will also emerge. If the new path is clear, the power to act immediately becomes stronger.

D: New abilities can take new paths.

For example, creating a Spanish-language blog seemed like an impossible task for me. In the past, the feeling of machine translation from Google only allowed you to read some materials but couldn't lead to smooth output. But if you tell me to utilize ChatGPT, and make good use of prompts, as long as I improve this ability, I can take a new path and publish articles in the Spanish-speaking world. This belongs to the category where new abilities can take new paths, which can also add strength to action.

2.Action is a complex problem and shouldn't be oversimplified.

Action can be divided into action at initiation, action during persistence, and action after interruption.

Action at initiation is closely related to genuine and false motivation. False motivation, even if it looks real, cannot bring about action. 
Action during persistence is related to the ambiguity of the source of motivation, the simplicity of the combination of motivations, and also related to positive and negative feedback. 
Action after interruption is related to core attribution and also related to the sense of efficiency.
Therefore, for Elon Musk, doing precision work is enough to drive action. He has already gone through many obstacles, and genuine and multilayered motivations, a sense of efficiency, positive feedback, building new capabilities, etc., are not problems for him. However, it's not the same for ordinary people, so this process cannot be oversimplified.

Conclusion:

If you want to enhance the motivation for your stalled plan, you can do it like this:

Step one, you can try the ABCD four methods mentioned in the first part of the article.
Step two, if you're still hindered, you can refer to the three factors related to the motivation for action in the second part to find some answers.
Step three, if you still need to discuss something, you can schedule a consultation with me to reexamine your plan’s underlying logic and attribution from an external perspective.

See, isn't this also a form of precision?
