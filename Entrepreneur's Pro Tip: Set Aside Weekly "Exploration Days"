We've all heard the advice: "Keep your head down, but don't forget to look up occasionally." While this wisdom sounds great, it's often easier said than done. We either get completely lost in our day-to-day tasks or end up spending too much time consuming information that doesn't really benefit us. Here, I'll share some practical insights that frequently come up in my consulting work:

People Tend to Prioritize Urgent Tasks
When a task is both important and urgent, there are external pressures like deadlines or other people waiting for us. However, essential but not urgent tasks lack these external nudges. Our natural inclination is to tackle tasks that have external reminders, and we're good at getting those done. But you can use this to your advantage. By making an effort to address non-urgent yet vital tasks, your instincts will kick in to handle the more immediate work.

Memory Matters
Give specific days a name, like "Exploration Day" on Fridays or "Family Tea Time" on Wednesdays. This makes it easier to remember your plans. These days are often the first to get pushed aside when things get hectic. You don't need to remember the day-to-day tasks because your schedule reminds you. Designating days for special purposes helps you remember and act on them.

Systematic vs. Scattered Exploration
Many of us spend a lot of time consuming information, attending events, and meeting people, but these efforts often lead to scattered knowledge. Ask yourself if you feel that these activities have limited value but hesitate to stop them because they occasionally yield some benefits. That's the feeling of scattered accumulation. Systematic exploration, on the other hand, builds upon a solid foundation and follows a specific plan.

My Exploration Approach: Innovator in My Field, Early Adopter in Others
Think of it this way: in your own field, aim to be an innovator, pushing boundaries and exploring the cutting edge. But in other industries, be content with being an early adopter. Early adopters are already significantly ahead of the curve, at least 70% ahead.

Taming Pride and Greed
Exploration days are your secret weapon against overconfidence and unrealistic ambitions. They help keep you grounded. Don't forget to have a dedicated notebook for these days.
