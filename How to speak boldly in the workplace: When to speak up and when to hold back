How to speak boldly in the workplace: When to speak up and when to hold back

Workplace communication can be complex, and sometimes you need to push boundaries. There are moments when you must say something bold, something others won't dare to say, or something that might upset someone. It's natural to feel anxious before speaking up, but this simple framework can help you decide when to speak up and when to hold back.

Within beliefs: Bold but empathetic
When communicating about beliefs, be open, direct, and bold. Even though these are the person's own beliefs, people are complex and may forget or contradict their beliefs. By speaking up and reminding them, you show a deep understanding of them, making your communication constructive and safe.
A common mistake is not speaking up about beliefs and only saying things to please others. This prevents a deep resonance of beliefs. Remember, people may get angry because their ego is hurt, but the power of beliefs is greater than the power of emotions.

Beyond beliefs: Filter, don't force communication
Beyond beliefs, workplace communication can't solve the issue. Either wait for a growth opportunity or move on. Reflecting on beliefs is a personal growth moment, usually triggered by an event or communication with a coach or teacher.
As someone whose interests are related to theirs, you can't communicate about things beyond their beliefs. Either endure it or move on. Communication beyond beliefs is difficult, whether between superiors and subordinates or partners. However, sometimes superiors must act as teachers, and partners must act as coach , but even deep communication has limited effects.
As a team member, try at appropriate times, but don't expect too much or over-communicate.

Identifying beliefs

Identifying beliefs is crucial. 
Look for unstructured expressions repeatedly mentioned outside of structured expressions during meetings or communication. These "golden sentences" or "mantras" signal their beliefs. 
Also, observe how they allocate resources when limited. Who receives the most valuable resources? This reflects their beliefs.

In communication within beliefs, you reinforce what they already believe, making it effective. In communication beyond beliefs, you're trying to replace something they believe with something they don't, which is illogical. So, filter and don't force communication.
Communication within beliefs may anger them, but it could lead to a turning point. Communication beyond beliefs may also anger them and widen the rift.
If someone always communicates safely, encourage them to take risks within their beliefs. If someone always wants to change others' beliefs, encourage them to see the boundaries and leave room for maneuver.
