The Relationship Pattern with Customers: If You Can Only Be Lit Up by Customer Demands

Over these years of consulting, I've encountered many individuals with excellent customer reputations. However, even with excellent reputations, there are areas for reflection and growth. Here are a few points we often discuss in our consultations:

1. The Button of Energy Levels Lies in the Customer's Needs

When customers have high demands, your energy levels rise. You seem busy with many challenging tasks, but your energy is high. When customer demands are low, your energy decreases, and you don't feel like doing much. When customer demands are unclear, your energy remains low because you can't see what your customers need. When it comes to your own affairs, you lack the drive to move forward and wait for the next round of customer demands to ignite you. This is known as being lit up only by customer demands.

2. When You Need "Customers to Need You," You Tend to Over-fulfill

When customers discover you can over-fulfill their needs, they start requesting even more. If you were asked whether you prefer a partner who's a superhuman or one with limitations, most would choose the former. It's human nature to be greedy. When others see you as capable of doing everything, and you see yourself that way too, you both reinforce the subconscious agreement, making you even more capable. This leads to improvements in all aspects of your abilities, and you often receive compliments for being an all-rounder. However, on the flip side, striving for excellence comes with a significant opportunity cost.

3. This Pattern Often Neglects Your Own Needs

Commonly, your health, relaxation time, leisure time, and time with family are neglected. These needs are challenging to ignite within you, and you often find yourself in a low-energy state, not wanting to do anything when you return home after serving customers. This state is usually accompanied by low-energy compensatory behaviors, such as excessive phone use or overeating.

4. This Pattern Often Neglects Higher-Level Needs

Your mission is what God expects of you, not what someone specific expects of you. These missions may involve more innovation and venturing into uncharted territories where no one ignites you. Do you still have the energy to pursue them when you're not being lit up by someone else? I've encountered successful people who aspire to organize their thoughts better to help their industries and the younger generation. Yet, they continue to wait for someone to ignite them, wasting precious time and energy.

5. Striking a Balance Between Reputation and Performance

"Good reputation" is a complex term. It seems like Xiaomi's founder, Lei Jun, once mentioned that a good reputation means surpassing expectations. This can be further divided into surpassing expectations in core values and in non-core values. You should reflect on the key focus areas of your reputation. Are you exceeding expectations in core values, or are you expending excessive effort to surpass expectations in non-core values? How is surpassing expectations different from over-performance? Over-performance originally meant that users paid a premium for unnecessary value. We're borrowing this concept to examine which part of your service, when removed, doesn't affect the core value but costs you significantly.

6. Break Self-Consistency and Determine if You Want to Change

The first step in change is always to break self-consistency and identify the inconsistencies. Because of your strong capabilities and good reputation, you're even the envy of others. Hence, it's easy to feel self-consistent and content with the current state. However, when you examine yourself from the perspective of relationship patterns, you can see where you've been overlooking a lot. If you want to change and seek a more holistic state of life, you must begin to create experiences that ignite your own needs and the mission's needs. You'll discover that the new pattern allows you to have more areas of high energy. With this realization, you gain the strength to break into the uncharted territory required for innovation.

When you start seeing that the old pattern isn't so obvious, you'll begin to rethink, and that's the start of change. If you want more discussions on customer relationships, feel free to contact me via the Energy Thinking official account.
