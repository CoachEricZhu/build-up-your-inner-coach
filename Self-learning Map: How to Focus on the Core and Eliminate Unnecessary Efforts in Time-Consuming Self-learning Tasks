Self-learning Map: How to Focus on the Core and Eliminate Unnecessary Efforts in Time-Consuming Self-learning Tasks

Self-learning is an energy-intensive task. During the transition period, everyone's energy is limited, and when self-learning tasks begin, there is basically no energy left for thinking. Therefore, this self-learning map is designed to help you save some energy by answering these 9 questions, completing the framework of self-learning, making the entire process clear, and avoiding detours.

Here is the checklist for the self-learning map:

Brief explanation:

1. Determine resource constraints—Subtraction before addition
   - What is the current priority sequence?
   - Is there still remaining time resources now? Should other tasks be cut off? Are the cut-off tasks high-priority?
   - Is the scheduled time matching the energy level, and is it in line with the goal?

2. Eliminate potential internal friction—Without the right motivation, it's hard to persevere
   - Is it FOMO (fear of missing out)? Is it comparison with others? Is it greed for too much?
   - How is the self-learning self-efficacy perceived in such cases? Are there more setbacks or successful experiences in the past?
   - Is it a necessity or a passion, and does it align with the strategic mission direction?

3. Self-learning alone or with others
   - Solitude, collaborative learning, or collisions with others—Which mode is most conducive to stimulating your learning state? Really?
   - Has your self-learning time damaged family relationships?

4. Define single tasks or complex tasks
   - Explanation:
     - Learn English or achieve a certain score in IELTS (this is a complex task because it involves exam strategies).
     - Build a personal website or establish a business on the personal website.
     - Learn programming or develop a product through learning programming.
     - Most self-learning tasks should actually be complex tasks but have been approached as single tasks.

5. Define hard skills and soft strategies
   - Explanation:
     - Complex tasks are divided into hard skills and soft strategies.
     - For example, English is a hard skill, and exam strategies are soft strategies. Programming is a hard skill, and product design is a soft strategy.
     - Hard skills require perseverance, while soft strategies are in the innovation domain.
     - You can ask ChatGPT: "What comprehensive skills are needed for a successful [something]?"

6. Define smart work and effort diligently within hard skills
   - Explanation:
     - Before learning, figure out which aspects need to be smart and which aspects need to put in effort diligently.
     - If this is not clear, continuously applying smart efforts where dumb efforts are needed and vice versa can lead to low efficiency.
     - It's important to clarify: What are concepts, facts, and procedures?
       - Core concepts—understanding them more profoundly. This is smart work (you can ask ChatGPT about the core concepts in a field).
       - Facts—Requires effort to remember, this needs to put in effort diligently. (you can search for keywords like "comprehensive," "summary," etc.).
       - Procedures—Practice makes perfect, this needs to put in effort diligently. (you can search for keywords like "hands-on," "step-by-step," etc.).

7. Define schools of thought within soft strategies
   - Explanation:
     - Know at least two or more schools of thought and their ideological differences.
     - Once able to distinguish schools of thought, you won't consider one as the ultimate truth, and you can think more deeply about innovation.
     - For example, in product design, there are different schools of thought, at least some are "design-oriented," and some are "feedback and iteration-oriented." They each have their own boundaries and application scenarios.

8. Define outcome value and process value
   - Outcome value:
     - What result do you hope to achieve through self-learning?
   - Process value:
     - Explanation: Open and share the learning process, reaching sharing level, paid level, and enterprise level.
     - Many successful transformations turn self-learning into output, then into a business, especially in a solo entrepreneurship model.
     - Therefore, defining process value is more important.
     - Sharing level: From strategies to systematic summaries, published on social media.
     - Paid level: Results + methodology, can be used for knowledge payment.
     - Enterprise level: Able to provide professionals with new perspectives.

9. Define phased benchmarks
   - What does the beginner and expert look like for this matter?
   - What are the people doing these two types of businesses teaching?
   - Explanation:
     - Search for keywords such as "beginner," "entry-level," "advanced," "expert," etc., and you can see examples of phased cases.
     - Those who do this business often have the most in-depth research on this matter, so you can search for companies doing entry-level business and those doing advanced business to think about the learning plan.

In conclusion, learning is always a politically correct choice for ambitious individuals. Learning is never wrong, and learning new things will definitely bring some satisfaction. 
However, we cannot stay at this level of satisfaction. While we can learn based on interests, sometimes we also need to organize ourselves, and constrain self-learning within a framework—especially for transition, self-learning is aimed at solving transition problems, making it highly purposeful. 
I hope this framework inspires you. If you want to discuss how self-learning can help with transformation, you can click on the energy thinking official account to schedule a consultation.
