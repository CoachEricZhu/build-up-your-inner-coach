A brief explanation:

You can employ a long-tail medium + generic demand strategy. For instance, when huskies weren't in the spotlight, they served as a long-tail medium compared to other trendy pets. However, they possessed a humorous trait â€“ a generic demand. Generic  demands remain constant but can become tiresome, prompting systems to actively seek new medium. This drive assists the system in discovering you. Persistence over time and experimenting with various medium may be necessary.

You can adopt a popular medium + conflict demand strategy. For example,  For instance, pasta sauce is a popular medium, but a dozen niche flavors can create conflicting demands; some tastes may be utterly incomprehensible to others. 
Popular medium cater to widespread use but, due to the need to balance various demands, they become imperfect for everyone. This imperfection motivates some to seek more perfect solutions, aiding the system in discovering you. As popular medium are already imperfect, your task is to create a perfect product for a small group, boldly addressing conflicting demands and making another group dismissive.

You can utilize a popular aggregator + long-tail filter strategy. YouTube serves as a popular aggregator, and creating content with long-tail keywords on YouTube exemplifies this strategy. The growth strategy of the aggregator matters; if it originates from the long tail market, it's more inclined to search for and support long-tail content. If it grows more from popularity, its motivation is weaker. You'll need a more efficient and stable production system to cover a considerable number of long-tail keywords.

You can employ a long-tail aggregator + mainstream filter strategy. Various subcultures and small incubators serve as long-tail aggregators, actively supporting their own trends to break into the mainstream. However, entering a long-tail aggregator is like venture capital; you might spend much time and still end up in the long tail. Those who persist are usually heavy fans themselves, not opportunists. If you're lucky, the long-tail aggregator successfully breaks into the mainstream, giving you a chance to become popular.

In conclusion,

As a long tail survivor , make your body healthier, repair and build your support system, clear away self-attacking thoughts, manage cash flow, lengthen your runway, act with confidence, follow the rules, do your duty, and wait for the right moment to arrive. Just as James says, "Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it until it receives the early and the late rains."
