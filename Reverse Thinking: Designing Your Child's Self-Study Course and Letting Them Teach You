Reverse Thinking: Designing Your Child's Self-Study Course and Letting Them Teach You

When it comes to teaching children, things can get a bit chaotic. What if, instead of you teaching them, you let your child take on the role of the teacher? By doing so, you create moments of shared learning, with your child progressing and you absorbing new knowledge passively. I've been implementing this approach through a self-designed self-study course. Here are a few principles :

1. Unveiling Life's Realities

I share with children the five facets of life: responsibility, development, nourishment, entertainment, and chores. Completing homework and achieving good grades are merely responsibilities. It's equally important for them to focus on development, nourishment, enjoyment, and efficiently managing chores to grasp the true essence of life. By incorporating these five aspects daily and weekly, they understand that self-study contributes to their overall development.

This perspective holds more weight than the specific subjects covered in the self-study course. Many people default to completing responsibilities and engaging in simple forms of entertainment. Breaking free from this default mode can be challenging initially and may require the guiding influence of a parent, but eventually, children adapt to it.

Often, we hear saying like, “I don't expect too much from my child; just hope they grow up happy and healthy." This guidance implies a top mindset — maintaining simplicity and joy in the face of life's complexities, achieving balance between a busy life and good health. Doesn't this require a higher level of wisdom and more advanced training?

2. Applying the Feynman Learning Technique

Essentially, to learn effectively, one must become a capable teacher. All study materials are self-taught by children. They create mind maps to explain concepts to me. I try to understand their explanations and engage in discussions with them. Emphasizing self-learning and the ability to articulate thoughts is more crucial than the specific subjects they study. These two abilities are genuine meta-skills that remain relevant despite societal changes.

3. The Most Energy-Intensive Skill: output ability 

Output can take various forms: artistic expression (including music), coding, written expression, handicrafts, language expression (speech, debate), performance, visual expression, and more. 
Each child possesses a unique expressive talent, and the self-study course aids them in exploring and discovering their preferred mode of expression.

4. Starting with "One Page of Creative Thinking"

This book primarily delves into visual thinking. Children should gain a conceptual understanding of how to express thoughts visually. The most commonly used tool is mind maps, which represent the simplest form of visual thinking, proving to be more effective than listing information.

5. Focusing on Metacognition in the Self-Study Course

Metacognition, in this context, extends beyond the strict definition of "cognition of cognition." It encompasses a broader range — knowledge that I encountered
 after entering the workforce but would have been better learned earlier. 

Topics include time management, expressing gratitude and apologies, the seven habits of highly effective people, the pyramid principle, learning how to learn, leadership, critical thinking, and more. This knowledge comprises meta-cognitive skills, general skills, and some innovative skills.

6. My Standard: Offering the Best to Family, Just as I Do for Clients

Most of the time, our best mental effort, patience, and abilities are directed towards clients. This isn't to say we should give clients anything less than our best; it's about ensuring that our family also benefits from our highest capabilities. This simple standard often prompts self-reflection.

This was the original intent behind designing the self-study course — taking concepts frequently discussed with clients, making them understandable to children, and engaging in discussions with them. In everyone's most proficient field of work, there are aspects that children can experience and understand from a young age. Even if it's not your favorite work, there is always a part where you excel. This doesn't mean children will pursue the same career; instead, they will transform it into their own blessings using their unique catalysts.
