Many decision postmortems end up being a performance, whether for oneself or others. It's a showcase to the brain, saying, 'Look, I've reflected, and I've made progress.' Despite employing models and posing questions, there's often a lack of substantial change.

In consultations, decision postmortems are frequently discussed, and here, I share a principle that is often explored.

1. **Principle of 'Intolerance of Ignorance'**

   When we undertake something, there is always an underlying theory we believe in. If issues arise, it's reasonable to question this theory. If problems persist, perhaps it's time to consider abandoning the theory, right?

   However, reality doesn't always align. The brain is like a greedy landlord; its experience dictates that it cannot leave a room empty. An empty room is worse than having a troublesome tenant. Even if the existing theory is flawed, and there's no better theory in sight, the brain will keep the original theory in place. The new theory (new tenant) needs to stand at the door before the brain seriously considers evicting the old theory.

   In 'The Art of Thinking Clearly,' a principle is outlined: We don't abandon a theory when it's proven wrong; we abandon it when we have a better one. We never linger in the vacuum between two viewpoints; if we discard one, we immediately accept another. We can't tolerate ignorance, and we won't abandon a theory just because it's wrong. This would place us in the intolerable void of ignorance that the brain cannot endure. So, we may continue to err, but we won't give up the old theory until a new one is accepted.

   This creates a dilemma in the practice of postmortems: if there's an error, overturning the original theory without a replacement plunges into a state of painful cognitive ignorance. Alternatively, ignoring the theory's error and patching it up on the existing foundation appears to be progress, creating a self-consistent and harmonious cognitive state.

2. **Practical Suggestions**

   a. **From Specific to Abstract in Postmortems: Write Down the Underlying Theory**

      Initially, I was reluctant to write detailed consultation notes. After a few years, I started crafting concise notes, and now each consultation involves several hundred words. Behind this lies a deepening understanding. Consultation notes are not just process notes; they articulate the theory behind each discussed issue, sometimes comparing it with new theories. This ensures reflection at the theoretical level and ensures timely replacement with new theories, preventing adherence to outdated ones due to the intolerable void of ignorance.

   b. **When Advising Others, Provide a New Theory Alongside Pointing Out Errors**

      People sometimes recognize problems themselves, and at times, they even acknowledge flaws in their theories. But what next? When advising, don't merely highlight the existing errors; present a new theory side by side. This provides an opportunity for change. It may not be instantly effective, as the acceptance of a new theory is a process. Sometimes, the new theory might not be suitable for the individual, akin to renting a new tenant continuously until considering the eviction of the old tenant.

   In conclusion, Thomas Kuhn, an expert in the history of science, stated that the decline of a theory is not due to its inherent faults but because a better theory emerges. The theory of bloodletting originated from the humoral theory and persisted in the medical field for nearly 2000 years. During this extensive period, despite numerous cases demonstrating the inefficiency of bloodletting, people couldn't genuinely change. The intolerable void of ignorance made it hard to accept.

   The influence of theorists on the world and ourselves is profound. In your recent significant decision, reflect on the theory behind it. Do you have a new theory to replace it, or are you allowing it to stay in its original place?
