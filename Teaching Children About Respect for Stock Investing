I've been teaching my kids about stock investing and found they grasp complex ideas.  Here are some thoughts:
Everyone, including kids and adults, thinks they have great insight. But having respect for investing is tough. I've been teaching my kids to be good money managers, so I shared some investing principles.
I created a simple formula for investing: (must + possible) x when.
For example, my kid plays a game, and based on his skill and playtime, his score should be higher. I predict he'll reach 1,000 points, which is my "must" and why I invest. I put 100 yuan in, and when he hits 1,000 points, I'll get a return.
But I can't predict "when" he'll reach it. Also, there's a "possible" he might quit, switch servers, or have the game taken away. If so, I'll lose my investment.
Investing is complex - you invest based on your "must," but you can't predict "when," so don't try to time the market. There are many "possible" outcomes, so have a safety margin and diversify risks.
This simple principle helps kids understand investing's complexity and develop respect for it, which is crucial for being a good money manager.
