The Certainty Principle: How to Rise Above Environment, Feedback, and Inner Turmoil

Certainty is a common topic in consulting. What if your certainty turns out to be wrong? Even if it is right, it can easily be shaken by changes in the environment and internal conflicts, making it difficult to follow the right path.

The Three Levels of Certainty

Level 1: Judgment, Prediction, and Ability
This is the source of certainty for most people. At the start of something, people are usually certain because they believe in their judgment and ability to do well. However, this foundation is shaky because people tend to doubt themselves easily.

Level 2: True Logic and Belief
Some things remain constant in the midst of change. For example, when you are lost, spending time with users and solving their real problems is a business principle that will never change. Similarly, learning by outputting forces you to input, which is a learning principle that is almost always correct. When you do things based on such logic, you are more likely to be certain.

True beliefs can also lead to certainty. For example, someone's belief may be "Don't talk nonsense, making money is the most important thing." This belief may be true for them and can make them certain for many years. Until something happens, the belief may change to "Health is the most important thing" or "Being good to yourself is the most important thing."

Level 3: Recognizing Your Limitations
Even if you know the best path, it is not easy to be certain because there will always be a better path, or the path may seem "not the best" when it becomes too difficult.

True certainty comes from seeing that there is actually no other way, and that only the current path can lead to greater certainty. Why are other paths not viable? It is based on an understanding of your own limitations.

In terms of ability or opportunity, you theoretically have infinite possibilities. However, whether those paths are real paths depends on your limitations: time, energy, money, attention, health, family, psychological motivation, thinking patterns, interpersonal patterns, ability, etc.

It is important to note that the limitations here are not entirely negative. For example, some people are unable to work long hours and ignore their families. This limitation prevents them from doing certain jobs. Similarly, some people have no motivation or sense of vision and mission, which makes it impossible for them to work. This is also a kind of limitation.

After analyzing your limitations, you will find that you don't have many choices, even if it seems like you can do anything. When you are willing to accept your current limitations, the seemingly broken path in front of you takes on new meaning and brings a deeper sense of certainty.

The deepest certainty does not come from analyzing and understanding a path, but from seeing that there is essentially no other path to take, and that only the existing path can be walked well. This is what brings peace of mind.
