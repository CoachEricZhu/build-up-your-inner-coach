A common concern during consultations is the challenge of being overly devoted to work, leading to work dominating one's entire life and causing harm to relationships, health, and more. How can this pattern be addressed effectively? Below are insights and intentional practices discussed during consultations:

1. Clearly Understand Your Motivation

There are two types of pursuits: seeking greater success and aspiring to higher-level success. The latter implies a good quality of life beyond career achievements. 
In an era focused on happiness studies and economic slowdown, people's perspectives have shifted from pursuing significant success to seeking a higher quality of success. Psychological motivations are often unclear, and categorizing them as either seeking greater or higher-level success can bring clarity.

2. Simple Advice to Rest More Isn't Enough

Business is demanding, and true success requires full commitment. Merely advising someone to avoid going all-in at work and suggesting they rest more and spend time with family oversimplifies the challenges. For some, their career is a source of fulfillment, and for others, project commitments leave them with little choice. Advising them to take care of themselves without addressing the complexity of their work won't be effective.

3. Better Thought Process: Limit First, Innovate Later

The most exceptional buildings often arise from plots with the most limitations. To break free from the current situation, excel at work, and maintain a better quality of life, innovative solutions are needed. The first step is to limit yourself (resource allocation), as limitations are the premise for innovation. This simple yet profound principle states that to innovate, you need to impose restrictions, tapping into creativity, enhancing efficiency, and eliminating meaningless tasks.

4. Limits Foster Innovation - Go All-In Sequentially

Establishing a proper sequence is crucial. 

My sequence: Religion  - Family and Health - Paying Clients - Service - Other Potential Clients - Learning. 

Follow these three principles: finish what's in the front before moving to the back, sacrifice the back in case of conflicts, and innovate if sacrificing has a high cost. Limiting yourself leads to innovation. This means that going all-in without breaking the sequence will prevent regrets about neglecting health, relationships, and life quality.

In conclusion, going all-in at work while maintaining life quality is achievable but requires a shift in beliefs, psychological motivations, innovative thinking, and understanding the importance of sequence. Work-life balance isn't about forcing equilibrium but about re-integrating internal structures to achieve the desired outcome. Filling up time isn't going all-in; true commitment involves innovation. Only within the correct sequence can genuine innovation begin.
