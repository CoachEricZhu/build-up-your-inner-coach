Task management boils down to two mindsets: one where you feel in control of your destiny and the other where you see yourself as a steward of higher forces. Despite the array of task management models available, these two mindsets always underpin our approach.

Resource Allocation under Two Mindsets:
The Owner's Mindset directs resources towards creating new possibilities—most resources flow into fulfilling personal desires, predictions, and judgments.
The Steward's Mindset guides resources towards managing existing responsibilities—most efforts are dedicated to improving what's already been received but not adequately addressed.
No matter which task management model you adopt, a simple analysis of where your resources are directed reveals your prevailing mindset.

Resource Allocation Examples under Different Mindsets:
I often find myself oscillating between these two mindsets. In the Owner's Mindset:
Resources are poured into fulfilling my desires, which typically entail personal ambitions like book projects and AI coaching product plans.
Resources are also channeled into what I predict, such as forecasting future outcomes and meticulously planning each step.
Moreover, resources are allocated based on my judgments—what I believe I excel at, what I don't, what I can achieve, and what I can't. These actions may seem typical for someone ambitious and analytical.

The Steward's Mindset, however, has been a recent development for me. Under this perspective, resources are directed towards:

Being a diligent steward of what's already entrusted:
This involves embracing tasks I may not necessarily enjoy or initially believe to be fruitful. For instance, despite my skepticism about the readership, I began writing articles. As expected, the readership was low, reinforcing my initial judgment. However, adopting the steward's mindset made me realize that the number of readers shouldn't be my primary concern. Instead, I should focus on curating and sharing content that benefits even a small audience.

Being a responsible steward of family affairs:
This encompasses various aspects such as education, household chores, quality family time, and health management. 

Being a prudent steward of existing assets:
While I've always been attentive to generating new income, I've neglected the proper management of existing assets. It's a common trait among individuals to be sensitive to income fluctuations and minor expenses but oblivious to significant investments and asset management.

In my experience, these two mindsets dictate entirely different resource allocations. They profoundly influence decision-making processes and shape our lives.

3. Knowing When to Go All In and When to Take a Single Step:

Going all in means investing all efforts until exhaustion, whereas taking a single step entails leaving room for error in judgments and limiting resource investment where there's no clear stewardship responsibility.

When operating under the Owner's Mindset, I tend to go all in on what I desire, predict, and judge. However, this often leads to neglecting the present, mismanaging existing responsibilities, and encountering unexpected outcomes—a recipe for discontent.

Now, I've learned to reserve my all-in efforts for tasks that have already been entrusted to me. On such tasks, I push until there's no more to give, striving to fulfill my responsibilities completely. For tasks aligned with my desires, predictions, and judgments, I take just one step confidently. This balanced approach avoids overcommitting to uncertain endeavors while still making progress. After all, wisdom lies not in predicting the future but in acknowledging our limitations.

Therefore, I allocate the majority of my resources—about 80%—to tasks that have been entrusted to me. For tasks based on personal desires, predictions, and judgments, I allocate only about 20% of my resources, taking one step at a time and verifying along the way.

In essence:
"Fully commit to what's been entrusted, take cautious steps with what's uncertain"—this philosophy remains an A+ strategy even after two years. Reflecting on the tumultuous period two years ago, I realized the need to establish a guiding principle. The A+ strategy emerged, providing clarity and direction amidst chaos. Over the past two years, it has not only guided my actions but has also benefitted many clients in their decision-making processes.
